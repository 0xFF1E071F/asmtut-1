# Comments

## Singleline

Creating comments in assembly code is simple, just use the `@` symbol.

`@ This is a comment.`

## Multiline

For multiline comments the syntax is slightly different, use `/*` and `*/` instead.

```
/*
This is not merely a comment..
it's a multiline comment!
*/
```
