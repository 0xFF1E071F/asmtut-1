Assembly language is a low-level programming language just one layer above the binary that runs your hardware. It can be produced by compiling a high-level language such as C/C++ or written from scratch.

In this tutorial we are using Raspberry Pi with an ARM microprocessor and will write a little bit of assembly from scratch.
