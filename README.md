# Intro

[Assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) is a low-level programming language just one layer above the binary that runs your hardware. It can be produced by compiling a high-level language such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))/[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) or written from scratch. In this tutorial we are using a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with a [ARM microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) and will write a little bit of assembly code from scratch. You dont need to use a Raspberry Pi but **you will need a ARM microprocessor**.

It's true that assembly language is somewhat obsolete but knowing at least the basics does have some benefits. It removes a lot of the mystery around how high-level languages work and brings you closer to the hardware. Itâ€™s also a good character building exercise that gives you a greater appreciation for the pain that other developers have gone through before you!

I think every senior developer should write at least a simple 'Hello World!' application in assembly. If you haven't made that rite of passage yet but are interested then your in the right place! That's exactly what this tutorial is going to teach.

# Getting Started

The first thing you should do is create a source file for your code. To do this simply create a file with the `.s` extension. Try typing **`touch myfile.s`** in your terminal. That should generate a file with the given name that you can now open in your preferred text editor.

The first thing to know is that assembly programs are divided into sections. There are **three possible sections** but let's start with the main one which is called 'text'. The text section is used for keeping the actual code and begins with the declaration `.text`. This section must also include a `.global _start` and `_start:` declaration which tells the kernel where the program execution begins, see below. If you want to know more about sections look [here](https://github.com/jgphilpott/asmtut/tree/master/sections#sections).

```
.text
.global _start
_start:
```

Were off to a good start but this program won't execute yet because the `_start:` block cant be empty. To make this program execute we first need to know a little bit about [instructions](https://github.com/jgphilpott/asmtut#instructions), [registers](https://github.com/jgphilpott/asmtut#registers) and [system calls](https://github.com/jgphilpott/asmtut#system-calls).

## Instructions

Instructions are short **keywords with predefined behavior**, the most common one is `MOV` which is used for moving data into registers. To see a short list of common instructions take a look [here](https://github.com/jgphilpott/asmtut/tree/master/instructions#instructions).

## Registers

A register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's central processing unit. Most ARM microprocessors come with **16 registers** (0-15) each capable of holding a [word of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)). Some of the registers have special purposes such as `R7` which holds the system call number. To see a full list take a look [here](https://github.com/jgphilpott/asmtut/tree/master/registers#registers).

## System Calls

System calls are APIs for the interface between the user space and the kernel space. There are **six main system calls for the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel)**. For a list of the call numbers and their associated actions take a look [here](https://github.com/jgphilpott/asmtut/tree/master/system#system-calls).

# Step One

# Compile

Before we can execute any of the code that's in our source file we need to compile it to an object file and make it executable. Try typing **`as -o myfile.o myfile.s`** in your terminal. The `as -o` indicates that you want to compile a source file to an object file and you must provide the name of the object file with the `.o` extension and the name of the source file with the `.s` extension. Now if you type `ls` in your terminal you should see `myfile.s` and `myfile.o`.

If all that worked fine we can now make our object file executable. To do this type **`ld -o myfile myfile.o`** in your terminal. The `ld -o` indicates that you want to make an executable from an object file and you must provide the name of the executable (no extension necessary) and the name of the object file with the `.o` extension. Now if you type `ls` in your terminal you should see `myfile.s`, `myfile.o` and `myfile`.

# Execute

Finally we can run our executable by typing **`./myfile`** in the terminal.
